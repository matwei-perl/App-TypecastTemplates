App-TypecastTemplates

Format records from a table with different templates.

This module allows to print records from a table using different templates.
The template to be used for a record is chosen by the value of the column
named "type" for that record.

The table is expected to be CSV formatted.

The orignial use cas for this module is a script that allows to generate
.cloginrc files for RANCID to easily add new credentials. The accompanying
script does exact this and may be used as an example to create other scripts
using this module.

The module can be used without any script using the following command line:

        perl -MApp::TypecastTemplates -e tt_run

It expects the table in CSV format at STDIN and prints the formatted records
to STDOUT.
